      "    A robocall of unknown origin featuring a fake President Joe Biden is urging Democrats in New Hampshire to not vote in the state’s presidential primary, according to NBC News, the latest effort featuring AI-generated calls and advertisements this election cycle. The robocall message suggests voting will only enable “Republicans in their quest to elect Donald ... [+] Trump again.” The call, which appears to imitate or digitally manipulate Biden’s voice, suggests “voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” adding votes will only make “a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” NBC News reported. Listeners are then provided the phone number for Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair and head of Granite for America, a super PAC campaigning for voters to write in Biden’s name for the state’s primary. Sullivan—who said she first received calls on Sunday—said in an interview with NBC News that she would file a complaint with the state’s attorney general “because this is an attack on democracy.” Biden will not appear on New Hampshire’s primary ballot on Tuesday after aligning with the Democratic National Committee, which will hold its first primary in South Carolina on Feb. 3. Biden’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes. It is unknown who is behind the calls and how many voters were targeted. A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign said the calls were “not us,” adding they had “nothing to do with it.” A spokesperson for Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), one of Biden’s challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination, condemned the calls and said they were “wildly concerning.” Sullivan suggested whoever was behind the calls was “obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden.” Katie Dolan, Phillips’ spokesperson, said: “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy.” The fake Biden calls follow efforts by other politicians using AI to reach out to voters. Shamaine Daniels, a Democratic House candidate in Pennsylvania, launched an AI-generated call she said allows her campaign “an opportunity to get robust information and drive the conversation.” Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) released an AI-generated video last June of Trump hugging former White House medical advisor Anthony Fauci. A super PAC supporting DeSantis released an AI-generated ad in July of Trump reading social media posts. New York City Mayor Eric Adams—who won’t face reelection until 2025—was recently criticized for using AI to call city residents in languages he can’t speak, like Spanish or Mandarin. The World Economic Forum warned last week that AI-generated advertisements and misinformation disrupting elections pose the greatest global risk this year.
